microGL: A micro version of an OpenGL fixed pipeline renderer
=
Currently this is just a port of a similar project I wrote for a class a while back, but may work on adding some new features.
Adding support for a programmable pipeline using Lua for shaders and supporting a modern OpenGL programming style would
be interesting to work on. For now though this a super small subset of OpenGL 1.1.
